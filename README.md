Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned the dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculated summary statistics to understand the distribution of delays and other features.
Trend Analysis: Analyzed delays over time to identify peak periods and trends.
Line and Station Analysis: Investigated delays by subway line and station to pinpoint areas with frequent disruptions.
Delay Causes: Examined the reasons behind delays to identify common issues.

## Files
