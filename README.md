# TTC-Subway-Delay-Data--Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA

This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on the TTC Subway Delay Data. The analysis provides insights into subway delays, including patterns, trends, and key factors affecting service.

## Overview
Objective: To explore and understand the patterns and characteristics of subway delays in Toronto's TTC system.

## Analysis Performed
1. Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned the dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
2. Descriptive Statistics: Calculated summary statistics to understand the distribution of delays and other features.
3. Trend Analysis: Analyzed delays over time to identify peak periods and trends.
4. Line and Station Analysis: Investigated delays by subway line and station to pinpoint areas with frequent disruptions.
5. Delay Causes: Examined the reasons behind delays to identify common issues.
